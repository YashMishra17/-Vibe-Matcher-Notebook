        "# Description:\n",
        "# This notebook demonstrates a \"Vibe Matcher\" system that takes a\n",
        "# natural-language vibe query (e.g., \"energetic urban chic\") and\n",
        "# matches it to the top-3 fashion products using semantic similarity.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Workflow:\n",
        "# 1. Create a mock product dataset (5–10 items)\n",
        "# 2. Generate text embeddings using SentenceTransformers\n",
        "#    (simulating OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 model)\n",
        "# 3. Compute cosine similarity between query and product embeddings\n",
        "# 4. Output top-3 ranked matches with similarity scores\n",
        "# 5. Evaluate query quality and latency\n",
        "# 6. Reflect on improvements such as OpenAI integration or vector databases\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Deliverable:\n",
        "# A Colab-ready prototype illustrating AI-driven personalization\n",

        "# Nexora uses AI to make personalization feel human. The Vibe Matcher\n",
        "# prototype shows how semantic embeddings can capture emotional intent\n",
        "# and match it to real products. It transforms subjective “vibes” into\n",
        "# objective similarity scores, creating a smarter bridge between what\n",
        "# people feel and what they discover.\n",
